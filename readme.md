My twine narrative consists of a story based on the different classes of where people are born during tudor times. 
Wether you are born in a rich family or poor family 
theres different scenarios and stories created for each of the categories.
for the rich family side of the story it is extended onto getting married wether you are male or female, wether you decided to marry or not and if that mariage doesnt work out what happens
for the poor family side of the story, the only jobs they could have were either farmer or servant and both side of the story go onto something else of each of the characters lives
the purpose of this twine story is demonstrate how each of the classes lived their life during this time, since  one was more privileged  than the other.
with pictures on some passages to represent the statements and also colorful texts to provide with a more delighful view while nagavting and playing through the story.
